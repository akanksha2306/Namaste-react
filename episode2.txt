npm
how to create your own reat app?

npm init 
give the 
description it ask- This is namaste react by akshay saini
test:jest
entry point:App.js

now a package.json file will be created(once you put in all the values)

package.json is a configuration for npm.npm is package manager that will manager
all the packages in our system.And sometimes these packages are also called as dependacncies.
most important dependancy in our package is the bundler.Before sending our code to production our whole code needs to be clean, complied and production ready, for 
that we need bundler.bundler basically packages your app to ship to production.
create-react-app uses webpack bundler.
bundler-

npm install -D parcel [by writing -D, I tell npm that I 
need parcel as a dev dependancy and not as a normal/production dependancy]


Our project has a package.json, we need parcel as a dependancy, 
now parcel also needs some of its own dependancies, it comes with 
its own dependancies, those dependancies might need its own.this 
is called transitive dependencies.parcel also depends on other dependancies
it needs help of other packages.parcel needs help of babel too.


every dependancy has its own package.json.

 If you have package.json and package.lock.json, 
 you can re-create your node modules(do npm install, it will recreate node_modules).
 So you dont need to 
 push node modules on github.You shud push package.json and 
 package.lock.json on github.

 
 
// const heading = React.createElement(
// "h1", 
// { id:"heading"},
//   "Namaste react!"
// );
// console.log(heading);

// const Title=()=>{
//     <h1 className="head" tabIndex='5'> 
//             Hello i am title
//     </h1>
// }
// //react functional component
// const HeadingComponent = () =>
//  ( 
//     <div id = "container">
//         <Title />
//       <h1>Namaste React functional component </h1>;
//     </div>
// )

// const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
